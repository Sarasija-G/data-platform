## Key Standards & Processes

### 1. Data Quality Standards
**Enforcement**: Automated testing at every pipeline stage
- **Schema validation**: All tables must pass dbt schema tests
- **Business rule validation**: Custom tests for domain-specific logic
- **Data freshness**: Alerts for stale data (SLA: 99% within 4 hours)
- **Anomaly detection**: Statistical tests for unusual patterns

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# Example dbt test configuration
models:
  - name: user_metrics
    tests:
      - dbt_utils.not_null_proportion:
          column_name: user_id
          at_least: 0.99
      - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
          expression: "total_events >= 0"
```

### 2. Naming Conventions
**Tables**: `{layer}_{entity}_{granularity}` (e.g., `stg_events`, `user_metrics_daily`)
**Columns**: `snake_case`, descriptive names
**Models**: Descriptive names with clear purpose
**Tests**: `test_{model}_{validation_type}`

### 3. Data Lineage & Documentation
**Tools**: dbt docs, custom lineage tracking
**Requirements**:
- All models must have descriptions and column documentation
- Business logic documented with examples
- Data flow diagrams updated monthly
- API documentation for data consumers

### 4. CI/CD for Data
**Pipeline**: GitHub Actions → dbt Cloud → BigQuery
**Process**:
1. **Development**: Feature branches with dbt development environment
2. **Testing**: Automated dbt tests on every PR
3. **Staging**: Deploy to staging environment for validation
4. **Production**: Automated deployment with approval gates
5. **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for failures

**Quality Gates**:
- All tests must pass
- No breaking schema changes without migration plan
- Performance impact assessment for large changes
- Business stakeholder approval for critical changes

### 5. SLAs & Monitoring
**Data Freshness**:
- Raw data: 15 minutes
- Staging: 1 hour
- Curated: 4 hours
- Marts: 6 hours

**Reliability**:
- Pipeline success rate: 99.5%
- Mean time to recovery: <2 hours
- Data quality score: >95%

**Monitoring Stack**:
